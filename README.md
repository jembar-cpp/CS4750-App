## Reaction Time Test

Features four different tests to measure reaction time.

### Normal Test
Measures the time the user takes to react to a screen switching from red to green.

### Circle Test
Measures the time the user takes to react to a circle appearing, and tapping the circle. Usually longer, but not much longer than the normal test.

### Two Circles Test
Same as the circle test but introduces a yellow circle which must not be tapped. The user has to react to which circle to tap. Not much longer than the circle test.

### Aim Test
User has to tap three circles. Usually at least double the time of the two circles test.
